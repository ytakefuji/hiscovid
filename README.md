# hiscovid
hiscovid is a PyPI tool that calculates time transition scores for individual policies against COVID-19.

The goal of hiscovid is for policymakers to understand the fatal mistakes by their decisions.
Policymakers must learn their mistakes for possible corrections in the future.

The time transition score is calculated by dividing the number of deaths in the time series 
due to COVID-19 by the population in millions.

Scores monotonically increase so that policymakers can only suppress them, but cannot improve them.
Mistakes by policymakers cannot be corrected and are fatal forever.

The lower the score, the better the policy.

In other words, the score is equivalent to the accumulation of mistakes made by policymakers.

The perfect policy outcome means there are no covid-19 deaths. There is no perfect policy in the world, but
mistakes by policymakers can be corrected.
